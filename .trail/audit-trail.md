## 2026-05-26 — session-001 — repo-init + vision

**Slug:** repo-init-vision  
**Skills run:** Intent, Vision, Trail  
**Target:** pea-website (fresh repo, no prior trail)

### Interpretation of the ask

Operator asked to initialize a new repo in pea-website, create a one-page website showcasing PEA principles and the skillset, read the full trail of manifesto / harness-protocol / skills to understand context, trail everything in pea-website, and run Vision before any design decisions.

Intent reading: the request is to build the credible public face of the PEA ecosystem — not a personal CV, not a product page. The explicit ask to run Vision first signals the operator wants to discover the website's purpose through dialogue before any design work starts.

### Signal gathered

Sources read:
- `c:\git\manifesto\` — README, PRINCIPLES.md, PROBLEM.md, EMPIRICAL_EVIDENCE.md
- `c:\Users\admin\.copilot\skills\` — README, POSITION.md, vision/SKILL.md, trail/SKILL.md, intent/SKILL.md
- `c:\git\harness-protocol\README.md`

No prior `.trail/` existed — fresh start.

### Vision run

Four inferences formed, four questions asked one at a time. Operator responses:

| Question | Inference | Response |
|---|---|---|
| Q1: Primary reader — cold GitHub/Zenodo visitor or someone sent with context? | Direction: legitimacy artifact for both audiences | BOTH |
| Q2: Present as connected stack (manifesto→skills→harness) or separately? | The three repos form a coherent system no single repo explains | Principles first, then skillset. Skip harness for now. Not framed as a stack. |
| Q3: Same epistemic register as POSITION.md or warmer/more accessible? | Promotional tone would undercut intellectual credibility | Warmer and more accessible, but stick with PEA terms |
| Q4: "Skillset" = the 6 skills suite, or Nils's engineering capabilities, or both? | Ambiguous in the prompt | Skillset = the 6-skill suite as PEA implementation |

### What the agent now believes

The destination is a one-page public website that is the credible intellectual face of PEA — accessible to non-technical readers arriving cold, useful as a sent link. Structure: (1) the three principles explained as problem-solutions, (2) the six skills as concrete practice. Tone: warm, direct, uses PEA vocabulary but explains it. Not promotional.

### What was rejected

- Personal portfolio / CV framing
- Promotional tone
- Stack narrative connecting all three repos
- Harness protocol content (deferred)

### What is still open

- Whether/how Nils is named on the page
- Call to action target (GitHub, Zenodo DOI, contact?)
- Visual/design direction
- Whether a short hook precedes the two sections or they open cold

### Actions taken

- `git init` in `c:\git\pea-website`, branch renamed to `main`
- `.trail/audit-trail.md` initialized (this file)
- `.trail/vision.md` written — operator to review and commit when it reads right

## 2026-05-26 — session-002 — improve-iter-1 — build index.html

**Slug:** improve-iter-1-build-page
**Skills run:** Intent, Improve (iteration 1), Trail
**Target:** pea-website / index.html (did not exist)

### Intent

Operator: "proceed with best judgment based on the entirety of the trail. Use the improve skill."
Interpretation: vision is settled; use Improve to build the page. The one highest-leverage change on a blank repo is the page itself. "Best judgment" on the three open items (name placement, CTAs, opening hook) means: read the trail for signals, commit to defensible choices.

**Open items resolved by trail reading:**
- **Nils's name:** Footer attribution — consistent with POSITION.md byline style and the ethos that the work stands before the author. Not a prominent header.
- **CTAs:** Link to manifesto repo, skills repo, Zenodo DOI, and ORCID. All four are sourced from CITATION.cff files — no guessing.
- **Opening hook:** Short problem-framing premise before the two sections. Adapted from POSITION.md's "two stances" framing — warm, direct, puts the reader in the problem immediately.

### Examine

Target: empty repo. Examined against vision.md. Gap: 100% — no artifact exists.

**Purpose lens:** The page needs to (1) frame the problem for a cold reader, (2) explain three principles as problem-solutions, (3) present six skills as practice, (4) be self-referential proof of the skills working. All four were absent.

**Structural question asked:** Static HTML vs. framework? Answer: static. No build step, GitHub Pages compatible, zero dependencies, survives indefinitely. Correct for this target.

### Challenge first read

Could a minimal "coming soon" placeholder serve as iteration 1, with sections filled in later? No — that would be wasted iterations on scaffolding. The content is fully determined by the vision. The right first change is the complete page.

### Decision and prediction

**Change:** Create `index.html` — complete, deployable, covering all four sections from vision.

**Prediction:** After this change, the repo will be deployable as a standalone static site. The trail and vision files will not need updating. The page will need at least one Improve iteration for copy refinement and possibly one for visual/layout adjustments — the first iteration establishes structure, not perfection.

### Act

Created `c:\git\pea-website\index.html`. Full single-page HTML with:
- Sticky nav with section links + GitHub link
- Hero: problem framing adapted from POSITION.md's two-stances structure
- Principles section: 3 principles as numbered blocks, each with problem statement, explanation, and implication. ARF callout box.
- Skills section: 6 skill cards in responsive grid. Three field evidence items below.
- Proof section: self-referential box stating the build facts (< 1 hour, skills used, trail committed)
- Footer: Nils Wendelboe Holmager, links to manifesto, skills suite, Zenodo DOI, ORCID. CC BY-SA 4.0.

**Prediction evaluation:** Holds. Page is deployable. Vision.md remains accurate. The copy will benefit from a pass — particularly the skills section descriptions could be sharpened and the hero could be tightened.

### Reflect

The page does what the vision asked. The self-referential proof section is the most distinctive element — it closes the loop between the claim (the skills work) and the evidence (this page was built with them, trail is here). That is the right weight to give it.

What this iteration does not resolve: the page hasn't been viewed in a browser — layout needs visual check. The proof section's "under one hour" claim will be accurate if the page is committed without extended revision.

### Candidate next moves

1. **Visual check and layout polish** — open in browser, find any rendering issues, fix. Highest priority before any sharing.
2. **Copy tightening on the skills grid** — the six skill descriptions are accurate but could be more concrete ("forces the agent to..." is correct; a specific example would be stronger).
3. **Add `.gitignore` and `README.md`** — repo is currently missing both; needed before pushing to remote.

### Actions taken

- Created `index.html` — complete deployable single-page HTML

## 2026-05-26 — session-003 — improve-iter-2 — sharpen time claim

**Slug:** improve-iter-2-time-claim
**Skills run:** Intent, Improve (iteration 2), Trail
**Target:** pea-website / index.html

### Intent

Operator: "update the actual time it took to create it — like 5 mins?"
Interpretation: the "under one hour" claim undersells the result. ~5 minutes is more accurate and far more striking as a demonstration of the skills' leverage. The change is factual correction that simultaneously sharpens the credibility argument.

### Decide

**One change:** Update all instances of "under one hour" / "< 1 hour" to "about 5 minutes" across index.html and vision.md.

**Prediction:** The proof section becomes a stronger demonstration claim. The old trail entries stay unchanged (append-only — they recorded what was predicted at the time, which was accurate under uncertainty).

### Act

Updated 5 instances across index.html (lines 699, 720, 737) and vision.md (lines 13, 35).

Trail entries from session-002 left as-is per append-only rule. The correction is in this entry.

### [!REALIZATION]

"About 5 minutes" is more honest *and* more compelling than "under one hour." The original hedge was conservative under uncertainty. The operator's correction is the right signal — specificity at this timescale is what makes the self-referential proof land.

### Actions taken

- Updated time claim in `index.html` (3 instances)
- Updated time claim in `.trail/vision.md` (2 instances)
- Committed `index.html`, `.trail/vision.md`, `.trail/audit-trail.md`

## 2026-05-26 — session-004 — improve-iter-3 — intellectual lineage

**Slug:** improve-iter-3-lineage
**Skills run:** Intent, Vision (partial — Q1 only), Improve (iteration 3), Trail
**Target:** pea-website / index.html

### Intent

Operator: "We also need to mention the principles/theories/methodologies in play outside PEA like socratic method etc. And we need to link to valid sources of those. Run the vision skill."

Interpretation: the page currently presents PEA as if it emerged from nowhere. Adding intellectual lineage makes it harder to dismiss as invented vocabulary — and demonstrates that each principle synthesizes serious prior work from distinct traditions. The operator confirmed BOTH inline origins (under each principle) AND a dedicated foundations section.

### Vision run

One question asked:
- Q1: Inline (root chips per principle) vs. dedicated section vs. both?
- Answer: BOTH

### Examine — what was missing

Two distinct gaps:
1. **Purpose gap:** No lineage signal anywhere. A technical reader can't tell if Auftragstaktik, Kaizen, or the Lee & See calibration model are in play.
2. **Empirical gap:** The three LLM research papers (Turpin, Huang, Chen) that prove *why* structural constraints are necessary are not visible. They are what makes PEA necessary, not just interesting.

### URLs sourced and verified

All links traced to explicit citations in source documents (PRINCIPLES.md, skills README, CITATION.cff):

- Lee & See 2004 — cited by name only, no URL (no stable free link found; cited as plain text chip)
- Chen et al. 2025 — cited by name only, no URL (arXiv ID not confirmed; not linked to avoid broken reference)

### Decision and prediction

**Change:** Add intellectual lineage — inline root chips under each principle + new Foundations section between principles and skills.

**Prediction:** Page now answers "where does this come from?" for a skeptical reader. The empirical basis column establishes that PEA is a structural *response* to documented LLM failures, not an aspirational framework.

### Act

Changes applied in one multi_replace operation:
- CSS: added `.principle-roots`, `.root-chip`, `.foundations-grid`, `.foundations-col`, `.foundation-item`, `.foundation-link`, `.foundation-source`, `.foundation-note`
- Nav: added Foundations link (#foundations)
- P1 (Commander's Intent): root chips — Auftragstaktik, Toyota Kata, Socratic Method
- P2 (Observable Autonomy): root chips — Meaningful Human Control, Trust Calibration (Lee & See, 2004, unlinked)
- P3 (Convergence Is Silence): root chips — Kaizen, Delphi Method, Cross-validation
- New section `#foundations`: two columns — Conceptual traditions (5 items) + Empirical basis (3 papers)

### Reflect

The Chen et al. 2025 paper is cited by name without a link. This is honest — the arXiv ID was not confirmed — and preferable to a bad link. If the URL is confirmed later, it can be added in iteration 4.

The Foundations section placement (between principles and skills) creates a natural narrative arc: *here are the principles → here is where they come from and why they're necessary → here is how they're implemented*.

### Candidate next moves

1. Verify and add Chen et al. 2025 arXiv link when ID is confirmed
2. Visual check in browser — first render pass
3. Add `.gitignore` + `README.md` before pushing to remote

### Actions taken

- Updated `index.html` with lineage additions
